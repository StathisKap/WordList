Hello there Mr Smith,
It's a great pleasure to talk to you tonight. How was your trip?
“There are a myriad of vitamins that are fat-soluble, 
as well as non-vitamin nutrients like carotenoids, which are 
positively associated with better brain function. 
Their absorption is negligible unless consumed with fat,” 
Lugavere said. “So if you’re consuming a fat-free salad, it’s a
massively missed opportunity to absorb these carotenoids, which
research shows can actually boost visual processing speed” ― the pace
at which you perceive and respond to things ― “by 20 percent,
even if you’re young and healthy.”
